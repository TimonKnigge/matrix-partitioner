	\section{Hardness results}
	In this section we will formally analyze the matrix partitioning
	problem and prove that it is \NP-Complete, even if we fix the
	the number of processors to $k = 2$. We will assume we are looking
	for a perfect partitioning, i.e. with imbalance parameter $\epsilon = 0$.

	\subsection{Preliminaries}
	To begin, let us define a formal decision-variant of the matrix
	partitioning problem for $k = 2$, based on the optimization
	variant described in \ref{introductory-section} where the goal
	is to minimize the total communication volume.

	\begin{problem}
		\problemtitle{\mbpt}
		\probleminput{A $n\times m$ matrix $M$, whose nonzeros are precisely
			indexed by the set
			$Z \subseteq \{\, 1, \dots, n \,\} \times
				\{\, 1, \dots, m \,\}$, and an integer $V$, the required
			maximum volume.}
		\problemquestion{Does there exist a disjoint partitioning of $Z$
			into $Z_1 \cup Z_2$ such that $|Z_1| = |Z_2|$ and volume
			$VOL(Z_1, Z_2) \leq V$?}
	\end{problem}

	Here $VOL(Z_1, Z_2)$ counts the number of rows and columns that
	have nonzeros in $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, as before.

	When thinking about the matrix bipartitioning problem, it is helpful
	to reformulate it in terms of graphs. Given an $n \times m$ matrix $M$
	we can define a bipartite adjacency graph $G(M) = (V(M), E(M))$ with
	$n$ vertices representing the rows of $M$, and $m$ vertices representing
	the columns, where a row vertex $r$ and a column vertex $c$ are connected
	if and only if $M_{rc}$ is nonzero.

	This equivalence extends to the partitioning problem. A bipartitioning of
	the nonzeros of $M$ corresponds to a bipartitioning of the edges of $G(M)$,
	and the rows and columns contributing to the final volume are correspond
	precisely to the vertices with edges in both sides of the partition. See
	also figure \ref{figure-for-graph-equiv}

	To this end

	\begin{abstract}
		We formulate the sparse matrix bipartitioning problem of
		minimizing the communication volume in parallel sparse
		matrix-vector multiplication. We prove its \NP-completeness
		in the perfectly balanced case, where both parts of the
		partitioned matrix must have an equal number of nonzeros,
		by reduction from the graph bisection problem.

		We present an improved exact branch-and-bound algorithm
		which finds the minimum communication volume for a given
		maximum allowed imbalance. The algorithm is based on a
		maximum-flow bound and a packing bound, which extend
		previous matching and packing bounds.

		We implemented the algorithm in a new program called MP
		(Matrix Partitioner), which solved 832 matrices from the
		SuiteSparse collection to optimality, each within 24 hours
		of CPU-time. Furthermore, MP solved the difficult problem
		of the matrix \texttt{cage6} in about 3 days. The new
		program is about 13.8 times faster than the previous program
		MondriaanOpt.
